## Installation Guide

### 2-Photon Imaging Analysis

1. *Details pending.*

### 2-Photon Imaging Analysis (CNMF Analysis)

1. **Create Conda environment**:  
   ```bash
   conda create --name my_env python=3.10
   ```
2. **Activate Conda environment**:  
   ```bash
   conda activate my_env
   ```
3. Install CNMF library:
   ```bash
   conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
   mamba create -n caiman -c conda-forge caiman
   conda activate caiman
   ```

The installation typically takes around 30 minutes on a standard desktop.

### 1-Photon Imaging Analysis
1. **Install Matlab 2023b:**
Download and install Matlab 2023b from the official website. This process usually takes less than an hour on a standard desktop.

### Zebrafish and Neuronal Culture Analysis
1. Details pending.
